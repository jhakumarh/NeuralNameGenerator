# Neural Network Name Generation Project

Welcome to the Neural Network Name Generation repository. This project includes a Jupyter notebook that showcases the use of neural networks to generate human-like names. The model is trained on a dataset provided in a text file, learning patterns and constructing new names based on its training.

## Contents

- `makemore.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook containing the neural network model, training procedures, and name generation logic.
- `names.txt`: A plain text file with a list of names used as the training dataset for the neural network.

## Setup

To get started with this project, you'll need to have Python installed along with the necessary libraries for running Jupyter notebooks and TensorFlow.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- TensorFlow 2.x
- NumPy
- (Optional) Matplotlib for visualization

You can install these prerequisites using `pip` with the following command:

```sh
pip install notebook tensorflow numpy matplotlib
